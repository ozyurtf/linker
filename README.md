Note that the although Operating System is interacting with the hardware, it is not a physical component of the hardware. It is made up from programs, code, and data that are used to manage the hardware and resources. Therefore is seen as a **software**. Like any other software, it is written to follow some instructions and it is installed on a computer's storage device (e.g. hard drive)

Operating system turns the ugly hardware into beautiful abstractions. In other words, it provides a user-friendly way to interact with the hardware which is quite complex to deal with directly.
